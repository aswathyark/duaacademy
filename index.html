<p>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The core principle of this new school was to have great teachers who were also outstanding performers - abolishing the idea that ‘those who can do, those who can't teach’. Our belief is that those who can, teach better, and their pupils have better results as a consequence.   Being a teacher is about more than sitting in a chair and supervising a pupil playing scales. It is about being able to pass on the magic of music to our students.                                                                                                                                            </p>
